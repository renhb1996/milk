## Abstract
  Thermal treatments induce variable physical and chemical modifications in milk molecules, which determine the quality of dairy products. Discrimination of the samples involved in different degrees of heat treatment can be used to direct further ingredient formulations and target products. An approach was developed to discriminate the degree of heat treatment applied to milk using an infrared absorption profile coupled with chemometric measurements. Samples were submitted to different heating procedures that combined various times and temperatures. Infrared absorption spectra of the samples were obtained without any preparation. Principal component analysis was applied in this study to extract characteristic absorption wavelengths of heat-treated milk by modeling the raw data of the absorption profiles after the samples underwent various heat treatments. The accuracy of the support vector machine model was as high as 92.31%, confirmed as the best performance classifier compared with k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and linear discriminant analysis, as evaluated by the area under the ROC curve. Thus, the present method, which globally exhibits the structural or chemical changes in heat-treated milk by means of IR measurements, could be a comprehensive and accurate approach for heat treatment indicators.
